# Sudoku Hacker

## What is it?

This is a parsonal project whose objective is to get introduce to backtracking and mouse/keyboard controlling. To apply these concepts, I decided to create a Sudoku bot that takes an input (the sudoku) and outputs the solution using backtracking and also completes the sudoku on sudoku.com

## How to use it?

**1) Download it:**

```
$ git clone https://github.com/Yagomfh/sudoku_hacker
```

**2) Run it:**

Input example:

```
$ ./solve_it.py 800010070004050002009004030050200000000000680900063000000000340700520001080000000
```

Input format: write each number on the sudoku starting on the top-left corner, line by line, down to the bottom right corner. Each empty case MUST be replaced by a '0' (zero).

**DISCLAIMER**

This program will control your mouse and keyboard to complete your sudoku. Don't freak out! 
Also, in this current version, the program was made with a 13-inch MacBook Pro with the setup that you'll see bellow. For those reasons, this program might not work as intended if you do not use the same display and also the same website.
